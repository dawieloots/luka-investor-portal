I'd love to help you get it insured.\n\nLet me pull up your account. I can see you currently have your Stellenbosch and Buffels Bay home insured with us. You have two existing vehicles covered, your Toyota Prado and your daughter’s VW polo. Your policy has been active since January 2023 and you've been claim-free for just over 26 months - excellent track record.\n\nTo get your Toyota Land Cruiser covered, I need a few details. What year, model and colour is it?",

Based on the 2026 Land Cruiser 300 VX at R1.75 million, your indicative monthly premium would be around R2,340. Now here's the good part - I've analysed 1,347 home and car insurance quotes generated by Hippo.co.za in the past 30 days by customers with profiles similar to yours (Western Cape, 45-55 years old, three vehicles, two properties, claim-free history). I have also cross referenced your profile against similar profiles who submitted competitor policy schedules before joining LUKA over the past 120 days. Despite adding your new Land Cruiser to your policy, you are still paying close to 15% less compared to other insurance providers.",
